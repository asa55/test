                    I get a lot of joy out of digging deep into math heavy topics just for fun. A short story I like sharing about this... A mechE friend and I were sitting at a bar after work when he sent me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs">this 3B1B video</a>. The video asserts that under certain conditions, the number of collisions between two masses and a wall can be used to approximate the digits of Ï€ with arbitrary accuracy. There is a solution video that shakes out the math, but for whatever reason we became completely captivated by the desire to solve this problem ourselves. Back of the napkin calculations weren't cutting it. Luckily we lived at the same apartment complex in the same hall, and it was a Friday night. My wife and I were having friends over anyway, so after the bar we sharpened our pencils and got to it. For our other friends it was good for a laugh while we worked on this tirelessly through the wee hours (we have videos, of course). One by one our other friends dropped off and went home, wife went to bed, my buddy and I pressed on, crunching numbers. Must have been one or two in the morning when we finally sorted out the math, exhausted and exhilarated! That was quite a few years ago now, pre-pandemic era. But a cherished memory for me, and I think completely indicative of how I prefer to spend my spare time. We wrote some Python that I ended up dropping into a Jupyter notebook - if you want to see that in action you can <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexboxer4/digits-of-pi-from-elastic-collisions?scriptVersionId=14895614#538654">find it on Kaggle here.</a>
